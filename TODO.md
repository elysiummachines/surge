No crash recovery for active downloads. Only explicitly paused downloads are persisted. 
Power failure = restart from zero.O(n) file I/O on every operation via JSON master list. Will cause visible lag with large download history.

Add authentication to HTTP server — At minimum, generate a random token on startup and require it in headers.

Implement checksum verification — Wire up the existing flags. Verify after download completes, delete file if mismatch.

Write a real README — Installation, usage, features, screenshots, comparison table, contributing guide.

Split large files — 
concurrent.go
 → 
concurrent.go
, task_queue.go, work_stealing.go, health_monitor.go. Same for 
update.go
.

Add integration tests — Spin up a local HTTP server, download test files, verify checksums, test pause/resume.
